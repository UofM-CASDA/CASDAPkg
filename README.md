# CASDAPkg
Package with data sets and shapefiles

To install this package use the command:

devtools::install_github("UofM-CASDA/CASDAPkg") 

in the R console.

Then use this command for documentation:

vignette(package="CASDAPkg", topic = "CASDAPkg_documentation")

Currently this package is very basic and is meant to be a start to building something more complete.

Let me know if you would like to be part of the team working on it!
